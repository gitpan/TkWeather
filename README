SYNOPSIS

     tkweather.pl [--options=values] [zip-code] [site]

     tkweather.pl --help              (display usage message)

DESCRIPTION

	This program displays a nice square iconic button showing the 
	current weather condition.  Clicking the button shows the current
	basic weather condition values, such as temperature, humidity, and 
	wind.  Clicking again shows additional information, namely the 
	barometric pressure, UV, visiblility, and "heat index" or 
	"wind chill" or "misery index".  
	Holding the [Shift] key while 
	clicking displays a webpage showing the detailed weather info. 
	Holding the [Ctrl] key while clicking changes to the next weather 
	site.  
	Holding the [Ctrl] key while right-clicking changes to the previous 
	weather site.
	Double-clicking or holding the [Alt] key while clicking refreshes the 
	data. 
	Holding the [Shift] and [Ctrl] keys simultainously while clicking 
	exits the program.
	
	For anyone not from Houston, Texas,
	the old "misery index" is the temperature plus dewpoint.  Anything 
	over 150 is considered "miserable"!  I use this for planning 
	workouts.  The default is to use the more modern "heat index".  
	Specify "index=misery" for the old Houston "misery index".  
	"wind chill" is used if the temperature is below 70 and wind 
	is >= 10mph regardless.

	"site", is currently 0: "weather.com" (weather.com) or 1: "wunderground"
	(www.wunderground.com), 2: NOAA, or 3: Weatherbug.  If it fails on 
	the selected one, it tries the next site.  The default is 0 
	(weather.com).  

CONFIGURATION

     How to set up (Windows or Linux/Unix):

     1)  This program fetches the current conditions every 15 
     minutes (900 seconds) from www.weather.com,  
     www.wunderground.com, www.noaa.gov, or weatherbug.  

	Windows users:  

	If installing on Windows, simply run the self-extracting exe, 
	which will install everything automatically and only do step 4 
	below.  If the program crashes, try running the 
	tkweather_nogui.exe version and examine the output.

	For Linux / source users:

     2)  Create a "tkweather" directory in your home directory

     3)  You will also need to specify your zipcode either as the 
     command-line argument or add a "zipcode=yourzip" line in 
     $HOME/tkweather/tkweather.cfg
     Otherwise you get the weather at the author's zipcode!

     4)  The optional file:  $HOME/tkweather/tkweather.cfg takes the
     format (defaults shown below):  Any line starting with "#" is 
     ignored as a comment.

     #DO NOT DISPLAY MESSAGE TO STDERR WHEN FETCHING WEATHER FROM WEB:

     #DO NOT DUMP DEBUG INFORMATION TO STDERR
     debug=0

     5)  Copy the image "tkweather.gif" to $HOME/tkweather/

     6)  Copy tkweather.pl to somewhere in your PATH or wherever you 
     want to be able to run it from.  Make sure line 1 points to your
     perl interpreter.

     7)  To make this app appear in your AfterStep/Windowmaker "wharf", 
     add the following to your config file:
     *Wharf Tkwather - MaxSwallow "Tkweather" tkweather.pl &

     8)  run tkweather.pl -h to view which options can be set on the 
     command-line (options set on the command line overrule those set 
     in the configuration file).

     9)  Enjoy!
