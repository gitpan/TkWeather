NAME
            TkWeather, by Jim Turner c. 2003, 2004, 2005

SYNOPSIS
            tkweather.pl [zip-code]

DESCRIPTION
            This program displays a nice square iconic button showing the 
            current weather condition.  Clicking the button shows the current
            basic weather condition values, such as temperature, humidity, and 
            wind.  Clicking again shows additional information, namely the 
            barometric pressure, UV, visiblility, and "heat index" or 
            "wind chill" or "misery index".  For anyone not from Houston, Texas,
            the old "misery index" is the temperature plus dewpoint.  Anything 
            over 150 is considered "miserable"!  I use this for planning 
            workouts.  The default is to use the more modern "heat index".  
            Specify "index=misery" for the old Houston "misery index".  
            "wind chill" is used if the temperature is below 70 and wind 
            is >= 10mph regardless.

CONFIGURATION
            How to set up:

            1)  This program fetches the current conditions every 15 
            minutes (900 seconds) from www.weather.com,  
            www.wunderground.com, or www.noaa.gov.  

            2)  Create a "tkweather" directory in your home directory.

            3)  You will also need to specify your zipcode either as the 
            command-line argument or add a "zipcode=yourzip" line in 
            $HOME/tkweather/tkweather.cfg
            Otherwise you get the weather at the author's zipcode!

            4)  The optional file:  $HOME/tkweather/tkweather.cfg takes the
            format (defaults shown below):  Any line starting with "#" is 
            ignored as a comment.

            #DO NOT DUMP DEBUG INFORMATION TO STDERR
            debug=0

            5)  Copy the image "tkweather.gif" to $HOME/tkweather/

            6)  Copy tkweather.pl to somewhere in your PATH or wherever you 
            want to be able to run it from.  Make sure line 1 points to your
            perl interpreter.

            7)  To make this app appear in your AfterStep/Windowmaker "wharf", 
            add the following to your config file:
            *Wharf Tkwather - MaxSwallow "Tkweather" tkweather.pl &
        
            8)  Enjoy!
